## Taxation Model 

The intent of our model is to offset tax relief for subsistence spending using a higher tax on luxuries. 
Therefore, this significant increase in tax revenue suggests that currently, more households are spending wastefully than there are needy families! At the same time, 
it proves that while being more equitable with taxation, our adjusted tax model does not shortchange the government on its tax revenue.
