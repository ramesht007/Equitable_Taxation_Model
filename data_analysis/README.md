# Data Analysis


Two types of analysis were performed on data:

- Exploratory Data analysis was performed for getting insights about the data. 
<br>
- The data was divided into three diferent socioeconomic group (high, medium, lower) these groups represent different income groups in the taxation groups. We calculate thier anual savings, savingrate and average space per person in each hosuehold. We came across great insights about their living pattern.
-  Other than higher socioeconomic group many housholds showed they had very less to no savings at all which is a concerning topic.
-  Also Average space per person changed a lot from each group to other.
